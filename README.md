# Chipotle Stock Analysis and Predictive Model

## This project is a Jupyter Notebook Python analysis of my favorite restaurant's stock prices using stocker and a predictive model built with prophet.

## After completing this project, I can't recommend [stocker](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/Data-Analysis/tree/master/stocker) enough. It's built on top of the quandl financial library, which is also great, but stocker made this analysis a cinch and I will be using it in the future. I was also pleased with the usability of prophet, which I plan to use for another stock analysis soon.
